        review and manage all of your applications in your applications dashboard
      </li>
      <li>
        save applications as a draft before submission
      </li>
      <li>
        come back to your draft later to finish and submit it
      </li>
      <li>
        come back to your submitted applications later to edit them or withdraw your application
        in case you changed your mind or your situation has changed before the end of the application deadline
      </li>
      <li>
        save personal data such as your name and email address that will be saved
        for your future applications (you will still be able to individually adjust that information)
      </li>
      <li>
        manage your personal information and email preferences in your account settings
