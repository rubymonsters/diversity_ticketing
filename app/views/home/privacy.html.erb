<h2 class="page-subtitle">Introduction</h2>
<p>We take the protection of our users (“User/you/your”) personal data very seriously and strictly comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations. In our privacy policy below (“Privacy Policy”) we provide you with an overview of what data we collect for what purpose and how we ensure the protection of the data.</p>

<p>The controller is <strong>Travis Foundation gUG (haftungsbeschränkt)</strong>, Rigaer Straße 8, 10247 Berlin/Germany, registered at the local court (Amtsgericht) of Charlottenburg under HRB 158047 B), represented by the managing director Anika Lindtner (“we/us/our”).</p>

<h2 class="page-subtitle">Information gathering and usage</h2>
<p>When registering for Diversity Tickets we ask for information such as your name and email address. Diversity Tickets collects the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, and information as part of the application or conference submission process.</p>

<p>We only collect personal data that is required to provide our services, and we only store it insofar that it is necessary to deliver these services.</p>

<h2 class="page-subtitle">Your data</h2>
<p>Diversity Tickets uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Diversity Tickets. Although Diversity Tickets owns the databases to the Diversity Tickets application, you retain all rights to your data. We will never share your personal data with a third party without your prior authorization, and we will never sell data to third parties. We transfer data with third-parties necessary to our ability to provide our services, all of whom are GDPR-compliant and provide the necessary safeguards required if they are outside of the EU.</p>


<h2 class="page-subtitle">Your rights</h2>
<p>For further information on your rights, to withdraw consent, or to ask for deletion of your data, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:foundation@travis-ci.org">foundation@travis-ci.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Right of access</h3>
<p>You have the right to be informed at any time and free of charge about the personal data stored about you.</p>

<h3>Right to rectification</h3>
You have the right to rectify inaccurate personal data about you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed (for example, by providing an additional statement).

<h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
<p>You have the right to have us delete any personal data concerning you that we store.</p>

<p>
We have the obligation to erase your personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:
<ul>
<li>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed</li>
<li>The User withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing</li>
<li>The User objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the User objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR</li>
<li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed</li>
<li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which we are subject
The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
You have the right to ask for and receive the personal data we store about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance by the controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on a consent or on a contract to which the data subject is a party and that the processing is carried out by means of automated procedures.

Furthermore, in exercising your right to data portability, you have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another where technically feasible — and when doing so does not affect the rights and freedoms of others.

<h3>Right to withdraw consent</h3>
<p>You have the right to withdraw your consent regarding the use, processing or transmission of your data at any time in writing or by email to us. </p>
<p>In the event of consent withdrawal, we will no longer process and immediately delete your stored data. This does not apply if we can prove compelling grounds for processing that are worthy of protection and which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or in case the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, we will continue to use data if it is still necessary for the implementation of the contractual relationship (including, but not limited to, if you are granted a diversity ticket from us for a conference).</p>

<h2 class="page-subtitle">Duration of the storage of personal data</h2>

<p>We only store your personal data for as long as your account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as it is necessary for the execution of the respective purpose.</p>

<p>Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still up-to-date, whether a contractual relationship with us still exists, whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the personal data concerned are relevant or not.</p>
