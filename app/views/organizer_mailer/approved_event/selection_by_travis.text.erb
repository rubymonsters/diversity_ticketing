Dear <%= @event.organizer_name %>,

Thanks so much for reaching out and submitting <%= @event.name %> to diversitytickets.org.
You chose the option to have us handle both the application and the selection process.
For the application process, we use this form: https://diversitytickets.org/events/<%= @event.id %>/applications/new. After the application deadline has passed, we will select the winners and send their contact details to you, so you can give them further instructions on how to receive the diversity ticket and other benefits.

We've gone ahead and published your event, you can find it here https://diversitytickets.org/events/<%= @event.id %>. An automatic tweet will be shared shortly on https://twitter.com/DiversityTix.

Thank you for offering free diversity tickets to your conference. This helps raise awareness of all the work that still needs to be done to build an inclusive tech community, and offers possibilities to underrepresented people in tech to join your conference.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to diversityticketsorg@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Best,
The Diversity Tickets Team
