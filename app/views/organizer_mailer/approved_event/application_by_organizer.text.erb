Dear <%= @event.organizer_name %>,

Thank you so much for submitting your conference <%= @event.name %> to diversitytickets.org.
You have selected the option of just listing your event on our site and handling the application and selection process externally, so we've gone ahead and approved the conference.

The event looks like this now: https://diversitytickets.org/events/<%= @event.id %>. An automatic tweet will be shared shortly on https://twitter.com/DiversityTix.

Thank you for offering free diversity tickets to your conference. This helps raise awareness of all the work that still needs to be done to build an inclusive tech community, and offers possibilities to underrepresented people in tech to join your conference.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to diversityticketsorg@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Best,
The Diversity Tickets Team
