Dear <%= @event.organizer_name %>,

Thanks so much for reaching out and submitting <%= @event.name %> to diversitytickets.org.
You chose the option to have us handle the application and handle the selection process yourself.
For the application process, we use this form: https://diversitytickets.org/events/<%= @event.id %>/applications/new. After the application deadline has passed, you can download the applications from the event overview here https://diversitytickets.org/users/<%= @event.organizer_id %>.

We've gone ahead and published your event, you can find it here https://diversitytickets.org/events/<%= @event.id %>. An automatic tweet will be shared shortly on https://twitter.com/DiversityTix.

Thank you for offering free diversity tickets to your conference. This helps raise awareness of all the work that still needs to be done to build an inclusive tech community, and offers possibilities to underrepresented people in tech to join your conference.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to diversityticketsorg@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Best,
The Diversity Tickets Team
