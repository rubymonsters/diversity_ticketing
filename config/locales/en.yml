# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      about_title: "About Diversity Tickets"
      about_diversity_tickets: "<p>diversitytickets.org is a Travis Foundation app which helps conference organisers who have partnered with us reach out to minority groups by offering them ticket and travel grants. They can do so by adding their own event/conference and specifying how many tickets will be given away. Once the event is approved, it becomes publicly listed on the website and applicants can apply for it.</p>
        <p>The app was created to make the work around diversity ticketing easier for event organisers as well as members of underrepresented groups in tech. Organisers don’t have to set up forms for the applicants to fill out and can focus on other organisational work, while applicants have a good overview of which events are currently offering diversity tickets, through the event listing.</p>
        <p>Travis Foundation has partnered with %{ruby_monstas} to create this Open Source app, which they currently use in their diversity work with conferences. The app itself is currently offered for a fee as part of the Foundation’s diversity consulting. If you’re interested in offering a diverse conference experience to your attendees, %{email_foundation} get in touch</a>!</p>
        <p>Read more about the idea and concept on the Travis Foundation blog: %{travis_blog} %{app_to_diversify}</a></p>"

    faq:
      am_i_eligible: "Am I eligible to apply?"
      am_i_eligible_answer: "<p>If you feel like you are a member of an underrepresented group in tech — this includes, but is not limited to: people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, women and disabled people — and agree to our Terms and Conditions, that makes you eligible for a diversity ticket.</p>"
      diversity_tickets_options: "What options are there to use diversitytickets.org?"
      diversity_tickets_options_answer: "<ul> <li>1) Travis Foundation handles the selection and application process for your conference</li>
        <li>2) Travis Foundation handles the application process, you handle the selection process</li>
        <li>3) You handle both the application and selection and we only list your conference on our site.</li></ul>
        For option 2) we will send you a .csv file with all applications that came in through diversitytickets.org.
        Since Travis Foundation is a non-profit organization we depend on donations to continue the projects we build. To be able to put in working hours to manage your conference tickets and meanwhile still support our other projects, we ask for a small donation to Travis Foundation for our service. We will take into consideration the resources and size of the conference when asking for a contribution and are sure we will always find a way to make this work.
        For option 1) and 2) we will ask for a donation to cover the diversity consulting and management work of Travis Foundation. For option 3) the use of the app is for free, but a small donation around 50 € is greatly appreciated and will go towards hosting and managing the site and printing stickers for Rubymonstas."

      how_can_i_add_tags_answer: "<p>We currently only allow site administrators to add new tags; if you'd like to tag your event with a tag that is currently not available from the list, please drop us a line at %{diversity_email}. We will try to process your request as quickly as possible and add your chosen tag to your event submission.</p>"
      why_provide_a_link: "Why do I have to provide a link when I manage the application and selection myself?"
      why_provide_a_link_short: "Why do I have to provide a link?"
      why_provide_a_link_answer: "When you manage the application and selection process yourself it's important to show applicants (and your community) that you are serious about diversity and inclusion and you are trying to make an effort. A link to a form for the application or a dedicated page on your event page explaining how you will choose from applicants, what you're looking for and why, and what you want to achieve by offering diversity tickets goes a long way."

      title: "FAQ"
      what_is_diversity_tickets: "What is diversitytickets.org?"
      what_is_diversity_tickets_answer: "diversitytickets.org is a Travis Foundation app which helps conference organisers manage their diversity tickets and offer underrepresented groups in tech a platform to find events they can apply for. Conference organizers can submit their own event/conference and specifying how many tickets will be given away. Once the event is approved, it becomes publicly listed on the website and applicants can apply for it."
      when_find_application_approved_rejected: "When will I find out if my application has been accepted/rejected?"
      when_find_application_approved_rejected_answer: "<p>Every conference is different, so we can’t tell you for sure how much the selection process will take; two weeks from the application deadline usually give us enough time to process all applications.</p>"
      which_events_eligible: "Which events are eligible?"
      which_events_eligible_answer: "<p>Organizers that want to get help from %{travis_website}Travis Foundation</a> to handle their diversity tickets can submit any of their events or conferences for which they are willing to offer free tickets or travel grants — this must have been discussed with Travis Foundation prior to the submission. We expect the events to be inclusive and to have a Code of Conduct which will be enforced throughout the event.</p>"
      why_diversity_tickets: "Why is there a need for something like diversitytickets.org?"
      why_diversity_tickets_answer: "<p>Unfortunately, the tech industry is %{geekfeminism} far from being diverse</a>. There are a few projects which make us all aware of this problem, but the goal of diversitytickets.org is first and foremost to try and raise the amount of diverse attendees at conferences by specifically reaching out to members of minority groups who would otherwise not be able to attend a conference.</p>
